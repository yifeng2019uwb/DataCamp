/*
What is database design?
. Determines how data is logically stored
	- How is data going to be read and updated?
. Uses database models: high-lebel sepcifications for database structure
	- Most popular: relational model
	- Some other options: NoSQL models, object-oriented model, network model
. Uses schemas: blueprint of the database
	- Defines tables, fields, relationships, indexes, and views
	- When inserting data in relatinal databases, schemas must be respected

Data Modeling
Process of creating a data model for the data to be stored
1. Conceptual data model: describes entities, relationships, and attributes
	. Tools: data structure diagrams, e.g., entity-relational diagrams and UML diagrams
2. Logical data model: defines tables, columns, relationships
	. Tools: database models and schemas, e.g., relational model and star schema
3. Physical data model: describes physical storage
	. Tools: partitions, CPUs, indexes, backup systems and tablespaces


Beyond the relational model
Dimensional modeling
Adaptation of the relational model for data warehoues design
	. Optimized for OLAP queries: aggregate data, not updating(OLTP)
	. Built using the star schema
	. Easy to interpret and extend schema


Elements of dimensional modeling
Fact table:
	- Decided by business use-case
	- Holds records of a metric
	- Changes regularly
	- Connects to dimensions via foreign keys

Demension tables
	- Holds descritpions of attributes
	- Does not changes as often
