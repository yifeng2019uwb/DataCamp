/*
Name that data type!
In the previous video, you learned about structured, semi-structured, and unstructured data. Structured data is the easiest to analyze because it is organized and cleaned. On the other hand, unstructured data is schemaless, but scales well. In the middle we have semi-structured data for everything in between.


Each of these cards hold a type of data. Place them in the correct category.

Unstrctured
1. Images in your phots library
2. Zip file of all text messages ever received
3. To-do note in a text editor


Semi-Structured
1. CSVs of open data downloaded from your local government websites
2. JSON object of tweets outputted in real-time by the Twitter API


Structured
1. A relational database with latest withdrawals and deposits made by clients
