Partitioning and normalization
In the video, you saw the differences between the two types of partitioning: vertical and horizontal partitioning. As you'd expect, the names suggest how these different strategies work.

It might be a bit challenging to distinguish normalization, which you saw in previous chapters, from partitioning.

Can you classify the characteristics in the correct bucket?

Normalization
	- Reduce redundancy in table
	- Changes the logical data model

Vertical Partitioning
	-(Example) Move the third and fourth column to sepaerate table
	- Move specific columns to slower medium

Horizontal Partitioning
	- (Example)Use the timestamp to move rows from Q4 in a specific table
	- Sharding is an extension on this, using multiple machines
