/*
Database views
In a database, a view is the result sef of a stored query on the data, which the database users can query just as they would in a persistent database collection object

Virtual table that is not part of the physical schema
	- Query, not data, is stored in memory
	- Data is aggregated from data in tables
	- Can be queried like a reuglar database table
	- No need to retype common queries or alter schemas

Creating a view (example)

Benefits of views
	- Doesn't take up storage
	- A form of access control
		- Hide sensitive columns and restrict what user can see
	- Masks complexity of queries
		- Ueful for highly normalized schemax
