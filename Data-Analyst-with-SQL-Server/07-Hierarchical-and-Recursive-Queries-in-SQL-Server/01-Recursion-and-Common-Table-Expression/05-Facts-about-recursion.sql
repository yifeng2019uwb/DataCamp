/*
Facts about recursion.
Recursion is the process in which a function is called within itself. The function is called several times until it meets the termination condition.

In this exercise, your job is to find the wrong fact about recursion.

Recursively defined functions cannot be solved iteratively


Correct:
Complex functions can be simplified with recursion.

A termination condition is always necessary.

The execution time can be slow because a recursion function is called many times.
