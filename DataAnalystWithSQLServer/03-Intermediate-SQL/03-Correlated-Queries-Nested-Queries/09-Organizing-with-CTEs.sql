Organizing with CTEs
Previously, you modified a query based on a statement you completed in chapter 2 using common table expressions.

This time, let's expand on the exercise by looking at details about matches with very high scores using CTEs. Just like a subquery in FROM, you can join tables inside a CTE.
*/

/*
Declare your CTE, where you create a list of all matches with the league name.
Select the league, date, home, and away goals from the CTE.
Filter the main query for matches with 10 or more goals.
*/

WITH match_list AS (
  -- Select the league, date, home, and away goals
    SELECT 
  		l.name AS league, 
     	m.date, 
  		m.home_goal, 
  		m.away_goal,
       (m.home_goal + m.away_goal) AS total_goals
    FROM match AS m
    LEFT JOIN league as l ON m.country_id = l.id)
-- Select the league, date, home, and away goals from the CTE
SELECT league, date, home_goal, away_goal
FROM match_list
-- Filter by total goals
WHERE total_goals >= 10;
