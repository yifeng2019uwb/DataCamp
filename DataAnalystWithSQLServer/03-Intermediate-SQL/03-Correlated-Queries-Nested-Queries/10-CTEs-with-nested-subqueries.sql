/*
Get team names with a subquery
Let's solve a problem we've encountered a few times in this course so far -- How do you get both the home and away team names into one final query result?

Out of the 4 techniques we just discussed, this can be performed using subqueries, correlated subqueries, and CTEs. Let's practice creating similar result sets using each of these 3 methods over the next 3 exercises, starting with subqueries in FROM.

*/


/*
Create a query that left joins team to match in order to get the identity of the home team. This becomes the subquery in the next step.
*/
SELECT 
	m.id, 
    t.team_long_name AS hometeam
-- Left join team to match
FROM match AS m
LEFT JOIN team as t
ON m.hometeam_id = team_api_id;

/*
Add a second subquery to the FROM statement to get the away team name, changing only the hometeam_id. Left join both subqueries to the match table on the id column.
*/
SELECT
	m.date,
    -- Get the home and away team names
    hometeam,
    awayteam,
    m.home_goal,
    m.away_goal
FROM match AS m
-- Join the home subquery to the match table
LEFT JOIN (
  SELECT match.id, team.team_long_name AS hometeam
  FROM match
  LEFT JOIN team
  ON match.hometeam_id = team.team_api_id) AS home
ON home.id = m.id
-- Join the away subquery to the match table
LEFT JOIN (
  SELECT match.id, team.team_long_name AS awayteam
  FROM match
  LEFT JOIN team
  -- Get the away team ID in the subquery
  ON match.awayteam_id = team.team_api_id) AS away
ON away.id = m.id;
