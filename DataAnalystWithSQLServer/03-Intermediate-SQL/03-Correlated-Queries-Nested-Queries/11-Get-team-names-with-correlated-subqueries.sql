/*
Get team names with correlated subqueries
Let's solve the same problem using correlated subqueries -- How do you get both the home and away team names into one final query result?

This can easily be performed using correlated subqueries. But how might that impact the performance of your query? Complete the following steps and let's find out!

Please note that your query will run more slowly than the previous exercise!
*/


/*
Using a correlated subquery in the SELECT statement, match the team_api_id column from team to the hometeam_id from match.
*/
SELECT
    m.date,
   (SELECT team_long_name
    FROM team AS t
    -- Connect the team to the match table
    WHERE t.team_api_id = m.hometeam_id) AS hometeam
FROM match AS m;


/*
Create a second correlated subquery in SELECT, yielding the away team's name.
Select the home and away goal columns from match in the main query.
*/

SELECT
    m.date,
    (SELECT team_long_name
     FROM team AS t
     WHERE t.team_api_id = m.hometeam_id) AS hometeam,
    -- Connect the team to the match table
    (SELECT team_long_name
     FROM team AS t
     WHERE t.team_api_id = m.awayteam_id) AS awayteam,
    -- Select home and away goals
     home_goal,
     away_goal
FROM match AS m;
