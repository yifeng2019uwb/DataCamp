/*
The match is OVER
The OVER() clause allows you to pass an aggregate function down a data set, similar to subqueries in SELECT. The OVER() clause offers significant benefits over subqueries in select -- namely, your queries will run faster, and the OVER() clause has a wide range of additional functions and clauses you can include with it that we will cover later on in this chapter.

In this exercise, you will revise some queries from previous chapters using the OVER() clause.
